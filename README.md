## Google Apps Script GitHub Assistant
Read the instruction before using the extension!
Keep in mind that the extension doesn't support automatic sync between the project storage and GitHub repository. Therefore, you need to remember to push changes you make in the IDE.
The pull feature just mimics Git pull, but is not that roboust. Pulling simply overrides local changes, so be sure to commit any local changes before pulling!

### Known issues
You may need to periodically re-authorize the extension before pulling/pushing. Otherwise you'll get `[github assistant] undefined` error. To resolve this, go to the extension options and grant the permissions again for the extension.
